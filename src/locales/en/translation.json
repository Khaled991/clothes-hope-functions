  "articelDescription3": "Russia and Iran clash over Assad's body.\n Where is Trump?\nThe article was published on the Newsweek news website by Frederick Hoff, director of the Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East\nRussia and Iran clash over Assad's body.\n Where is Trump?\nSix years ago, Syrian President Bashar Assad betrayed his country when he authorized the shooting of peaceful protesters.\nAs the war in Syria entered its year, everyone in Syria and abroad adapted to the high price of maintaining one authority, one family and one footnote.\nObservers appalled by the enormity of the humanitarian catastrophe in the country are now waking up to new events, such as the regime's crazy move to bomb 5.5 million people in Damascus from running water: a possible weapon.\nQuestion: To what extent does this deadly junta fit Syria's future?\nMost probably, this is the middle ground for Syria, and this does not mean that this team is investigating the destruction of the state in Syria alone.\n Fadash is known as a long-time deadlock on improving them.\n The Fatah al-Sham Front - the former Nasserist Front - is also fighting President al-Assad just as it is trying to erase the national alternatives in Syria to the head of the devastation.\nSuicide bombers in Syria are not worth the trouble of carrying out operations except their cowards.\n But the regime, whose prisons have been closed by Islamist extremists to marginalize its opponents and its collective food-killing strategy, has become a unique category in which no one is involved.\nSome Syrians who oppose Assad are expected to expect his immediate departure from power or demand it.\n They have become aware of the harsh reality of the war against Iraq.\nIdeas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas Ideas and ideas and ends their mission to find ways to negotiate with Syria's biggest ruin - Bashar - without allowing him to devour them.\nThe symbols belonging to this camp speak with Russia.\n So far, his thought does not mean how Trump's administration deals with Syria.\n It was amazing how I described her words.\nThe bosses of this camp, like Turkey, concluded with two things: that Russia's survival in Syria is an ill-advised disease; here is Iran's stay in Syria and the death of an investigator.\n Both parties, Turkey and the opposition, have chosen to work with Russia\nTo work for two things, turn it into \"environmental protection\" from the campaign for change.\n Because we live in a time of \"fabricated news,\" accusing Obama of trying to force Assad out is very innovative.\n In fact, there was a certain song between and without the military administration.\nAs for Tehran, Assad's failure is more than just the facade of governments on the state.\n [Legal].\n This is the case with Russia.\n There is no confusion in Iran's vision of the Assad team's reality, and it is rife with corruption, inefficiency and brutality.\n But Maarouf knows something else: after Assad, Syria will not have to subjugate God to justify God.\nRussia favors increasing Assad and has turned into a healer for the country's unified surgeon capable of leading the process of reconciliation in the reconstruction of the country.\n But they know who they are with, and they know it from a broad perspective, however, it can not really be so settled.\nMoscow realizes that this can not happen under\nIran has no interest in breaking Assad's approach.\n As long as her husband has the upper hand in \"Syria is useful\" to its interests - the first part and the dogs on it.\nAnd because she knows that her man will not win forever, they are now building militia structures on a party, Hezbollah, to control the rest of Syria, as it does in Lebanon.\n In fact, the fighters remain in place.\nSix years ago, Bashar al-Assad embarked on a process that completely undermined his ability to rule Syria, as he and his father had done for four years in the past.\n However, his family and his entourage remained in power.\n As an agent for Iran, he illustrates the stumbling block to Syrian Syria.\n Mosqua is well aware that this is the case.\n Will you take any action? Is heser doing this?\nThese are the questions that Syrian nationalists and nationalists are seeking to answer urgently.\n And what they seek this only after the absence of America for itself from the scene",

  "articelDescription6": "Translation is the bridge upon which knowledge and cultures\ntransfer across nations.\n In the ancient\ntime, translators had troubles finding references and moving from one place to\nanother, while nowadays the new technologies and communications means has made\nthe world a small village which enable translators to bridge over these\ndifficulties.\n In a globalized world, translation becomes more and more\nimportant.\n It is considered one of diverse means of communication that builds\nbridges between different cultures.\nTranslation studies changed from linguistically oriented\napproach to culturally oriented one, which means that a text cannot be seen as\nan isolated element.\n The translator cannot deal with the original text without\ncontextualization in reference to the culture, political, religious and\nlinguistic aspects.\n The aim of a translator is to reproduce a text from the\nsource language into the target language, capturing the style of the original\ntext to have the structure of an original composition.\nThe translator deals with text in three phases; the first\nphase is to understand the message given in the source language.\n The second\nphase is to analyze the text in the light of its grammatical relationships and\nvocabulary https://erektile-apotheke.de/ The third phase includes two steps;\nthe first one is translation, in which the analyzed message is transferred from\nthe source language into the target language, and the second step is revising\nand restructuring the translated text, as to make the final message completely\nunderstandable in the receptor language.\nIn general, the translation process is not just to transfer\nthe source text into target language only.\n But translators should be aware of\nthe fact that the receptor waits an original composition that reflects the\nideas and message of the original text without misinterpretation in the\ntranslation process.\n As what is known, the culture is rooted in the language so\ntranslation is a process aims to enhance values that may be religious,\npolitical, commercial or educational.\n Thus, through translation we build\nbridges among different cultures.\n",
